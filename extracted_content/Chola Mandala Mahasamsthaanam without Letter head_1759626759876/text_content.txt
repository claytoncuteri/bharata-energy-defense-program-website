‘BHARATA’ ENERGY DEFENCE PROGRAM 
 
PROPOSAL 
BY 
CHOLA MANDALA MAHAA SAMSTHAANAM 
CHIEF CONVENOR: PRINCE A AMITHAAB


==================================================
PAGE 2
==================================================

Executive Summary 
 
Chola Mandala Mahaa Samsthaanam is a congregation of royal families, spiritual gurus and social 
activists who envisage reestablishing Bharata (currently known as India) in its full glory. We shall do this 
by first protecting our motherland, reenergizing our spiritual epicenters such as Hebbya, Ham pi 
(Kishkinda), Ayodhya etc. and finally balance human, environmental and spiritual energies of this planet. 
 
To achieve this grand vision, we employ both socio-political and spirituo -mystic processes such as 
Rajasooya Maha Yagnas , Vishwa Shanthi Parama Yagnas, mass visualization and education via main 
stream media, spiritual meditative practices that activate the hidden astral and cosmic abilities of  
human beings. 
 
Since 2005, following a divine ordainment, we have successfully conducted 450 0 Maha yagnas, around 
54 Shiv lingh installations, multiple idol consecrations, launching of a mass media instrument, more than 
a million tree plantations & many socio cultural rejuvenations - at national & international locations. 
 
Our yagnas and processes have very deep mystic connection with the political , economic, social and 
environmental activities across the planet. We have enabled 
 
- torrential rain falls to draught stricken areas, 
- caused economic cataclysms to close the rich-poor gap across the planet, 
- economic crisis to prevent military and terror attacks to Bharat from hostile countries & 
organizations 
- political instability in unfriendly countries through government shut downs (eg: recently in the 
USA) 
- inviting & interacting with benevolent extra galactic, inter stellar beings to eradicate the 
insolvable problems of the planet (global warming, drying of river beds, poison ous earth, over 
population) 
 
 
These abilities have been witnessed & cross verified by credible third parties including government 
ministers, military personnel, television media, scientific communities & spiritual  organizations. This 
establishes the scientific nature of our mystic instruments. 
 
In light of the recent terrorist and military attacks on the Indian army, the Mahaa Sa msthaanam has 
pledged to offer our mystic and psychic abilities in a professional manner to ai d the goings-on and 
protect the interests of the military and defense establishments of the Indian government. Thro ugh our 
unique abilities, we shall help the agencies to achieve their objectives of terror cel l eradication, 
economic suppression, environmental destabilization & eventually total surrender of the enemy nati ons 
to Bharata. All these can be achieved with a minuscule share (~0.000001%) of national defen se budget. 
This dossier explains in detail about our journey so far and also serves as a blue p rint for our upcoming 
activities.

Rajasuya Maha Yagna 
MAHAA SAMSTHAANAM ACTIVITIES – PAST TO PRESENT TIME LINE 
 
 
2005: 
 
 
‘Akhila Vishw Bharathiya Seva Samaj’, was registered at Mysuru, Karnataka by Prince A. Amithaab – our 
chief convenor. 
 
 
The Chola prince began conducting ‘Rajasuya Maha Yagna ’ in 2005. Fire rituals are called by different 
names in India such as Hawan, Yaga, Yagna and so on. Many fire rituals are evident in o ur puranas. They 
are still being conducted in many temples. This particular fire ritual is special because acco rding to 
puranas, it was conducted only twice successfully, once by Sri Ramachandra Prabhu and other by Matha 
Chamundeshwari. Rajasuya Maha Yaga is conducted before involving in a war with an enem y kingdom 
and has to continue until the enemy surrenders. Mr. Amithaab began this yagna under the g uidance of 
divine energy to protect Mother Nature and her inhabitants from negative energies and enti ties trying 
to destroy our planet by starting a nuclear war. Rajasuya Maha Yagna has been conducted ever y new 
moon and full moon till last month. The fire ritual lasts for about 12 h ours on new moon and is 
conducted for five days ending on full moons. 
 
2006: 
 
Meditation classes were given to the inmates of Mysuru Jail by Mr. A. Amithaab. It was an initiative 
under ‘Akhil Vishw Bharathiya Seva Samaj’ to purify the inner conscience and rid them off the stress due 
to social stigma. He also began meditation classes for the public of Mysuru city.

Beggar free city – Mysuru 
2007: 
 
The Chola prince continues the spiritual fire ritual ‘Rajasuya Maha Yagna ’ to prevent the outbreak of 
nuclear war and for the well being of everyone on earth. 
By the guidance of the divine, the young prince at the age of 23, took up a social welfare project ‘Beggar 
free city – Mysuru ’ to stop beggary in the heritage city of Mysuru. The beggars were provided with 
shelter in the rehabilitation centers. The rehabs were restored to good hygienic conditions b efore 
sheltering the beggars. They were later provided with employment to sustain their liveli hood. This 
project served to maintain a hygienic environment in the city, attracted foreign tourists and more 
importantly put an end to Child trafficking, Begging Mafia, Prostitution rackets and Po verty driven 
crimes. Mysuru Deputy Commissioner ’s office announced the success of the project on 08th of March, 
2008.

2008: 
 
On 19 th of June 2008, bhoomi puja of Matha Gandhareshwari temple at Hebbya, Mysuru was 
performed by Sri Vishwesha Thirtha swami of Sri Pejavara Adokshaja Matha in Udupi, Karnataka. 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the divine cosmos, after the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharatha, Matha Gandhari 
devastated at the loss of the entire Kaurava race cursed Sri Krishna that his race would perish si milar to 
hers and that Sri Krishna would die a painful death with no one to look after h im. Accordingly, his 
Kingdom perished with Dwarka submerging in the ocean and Sri Krishna ’s death due to the wounds of a 
hunter’s arrow. Sri Krishna’s demise happened at Hebbya, Mysuru and his body was cremated at 
Bhoomi puja of Matha Gandhareshwari temple at Hebbya, Mysuru was 
performed by Sri Vishwesha Thirtha swami


==================================================

==================================================

Haripur, Gujrat. Once Sri Krishna left his body, he became a paramathma (divine soul) and peop le 
started worshipping him as God. They called the whole universe to be ‘Vasudaiva Kutumbakam ’ – 
family of Sri Krishna Paramaatma. So the curse has manifested to the entire universe. As the curse takes 
its effect, countries around the world would start fighting against each other leading to a n uclear war 
and the world would come to an end. As per the divine, the only remedy to co me out of the curse is to 
please Gandhari matha’s Kula devi ‘Matha Gandhareshwari’ by building Matha Gandhareshwari temple 
at Hebbya, Mysuru and that this temple had to be built by Mr. Amithaab. 
 
So the Prince bought the land that the cosmos directed to be the death place of Krishna and the bhoomi 
puja was conducted in June 2008. The divine energy had warned Amithaab ji that he w ould face a lot of 
hurdles to complete the temple and accordingly the temple construction has encountered various issues 
and is currently stalled. 
 
On 04th September 2008, a rally was conducted by Mr. Amithaab and his associates under ‘Akhila Vishw 
Bharathiya Seva Samaj ’ to promote the idea of installation of metal detectors and CCTV cameras in 
public places to Mysuru city authorities. This project was initiated in the name ‘Secured Mysuru’ which 
focused on the safety of public and to check the anti social activities in the city. This projec t was realized 
with the installation of CCTV cameras and metal detectors in bus stands, train station , tourist places and 
cinema halls all over city. Later, the project stood as an inspiration as the sa me was carried out across 
the entire nation.

2009: 
 
On 06 th May 2009, Central government had released a huge amount of Rs. 1850 crore for the 
infrastructural development of Mysuru city in the name of NURM project. This fund was stagnant and 
not used for its purpose. Mr. A. Amithaab with the help of his trust Akhila Vishw Bharathiya Seva Samaj  
and media pressurized the authorities to release the amount for the city development. Finally the funds 
were released and the new KSRTC bus stand that stands majestic in the very heart of the city was built  
under this project.

Met with Indian Ambassador in Uzbekistan Mr. D R Sharma and requested permission to install Adi

After the Jammu and Kashmir visit, Mr. Amithaab left to Uzbekistan in the mo nth of June. He visited 
Tashkent and Samarkand. He met with Indian Ambassador in Uzbekistan Mr. D R Sharma and 
requested permission to install Adi Rakshana Bhu Vaaraahi Prathyangire and Adi Rakshana Bhu 
Varaaha idols in Uzbekistan. The idols are programmed to reduce terrorism in the continent of Asia. 
Uzbekistan suits the program since Uzbekistan was the native of popular conqueror Timu r (direct 
descendant of Genghis Khan) and Babar (descendant of Timur) was also a great conqueror who set his 
conquest to India. Up on the honorable ambassador Mr. D R Sharma’s most precious advice, Amithaab ji 
visited ISKCON at Tashkent requesting a place to install the idols. But not much of help could be  
received and the prince returned to Mysuru. The idols meant to be installed in Uzbekistan are still 
placed safely without being installed.

Mr. Amithaab and his team installed Adi Rakshana Dhana Lakshmi Prathyangira idol in Mysuru on 15 th 
February 2019. 
 
Amithaab ji and team has been planning to build an Inter faith temple at his si te in Hebbya, Mysuru to 
bestow peace and harmony among all religions and bless everyone to live toget her peacefully 
irrespective of Religion, Race, Gender, Caste and Creed. The temple would house gods and goddesses of 
different religion and a prayer hall. The idols required for the Inter faith temp le have already been 
carved out and are waiting to be installed at Hebbya. But the project has stopped due to lack of financial 
support and various local hurdles.


==================================================
PAGE 21
==================================================

The young prince and his team are still working to prevent wars and other catastrop hes. The financial 
funding has declined recently which has led to inadequate fire rituals and other energy  programs. The  
13 yr legacy of unstopped Rajasuya Maha Yagna and hard work is now difficult to  continue with 
insufficient financial help. The havirdanas (offerings) during the yagna and other energy p rograms have 
declined. As a result, the higher beings or devathas and their army are becoming weak.

The manifestation of positive energy has lessened and the energy shields around our nation are 
weakening. This is evident from the recent chain of events, 
 
1. Pulwama attack on 14th February 2019 resulting in the death of our beloved soldiers, 
2. IED blast killing an Army officer at Rajouri on 15th February 2019, 
3. A mid air clash between two Surya kirans in Air Show in Bengaluru on 19 th February 2019 killing 
a pilot and injuring 2 pilots, 
4. A snow avalanche in Himachal Pradesh on 20th February 2019 killing an Army jawan and 5 others 
missing, 
5. Forest fire at Bandipur National forest, Karnataka since 21st February 2019 for 5 continuous days 
and still raging resulting in the loss of vast jungle and many inhabiting animals, 
6. A courageous and brave act by our IAF pilots bombarding a ton of bomb  payload on terrorist 
camps in PoK on 26 th February 2019 which may create a war like situation with Pakistan; 
something that Mr. Amithaab has been struggling to prevent. 
7. An IAF Mig 17 transport chopped crashed at Budgam region of Jammu and Kashmir and a 
Pakistani F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Indian Air Force for air space violatio n at Lam valley. 
The Universities at Pok region, Amritsar and Punjab shut down. 
More continues to happen….

the title ‘Kondai Katti Thondai Mandala Velaalan’ – which translates to ‘Royal family with hair tied in a 
bun like Lord Shiva, ruling Chennai and surrounding regions ’. This royal family has had very notable

‘Auroville’-township in Tamil Nadu 
Smt. T Krishnaveni , Mr. A Amithaab ’s mother was a co founder of ‘Auroville’-township in Tamil Nadu 
and co founder and trustee of ‘Fraternity’. 
 
 
Being born in the Chola royal family, Mr. A. Amithaab inherited the infl uential qualities of his parents 
and an inclination towards spirituality like his ancestors. He started perceiving spi ritual cosmic energies 
and had super normal intuitive abilities. He had out of world experiences that were qu ite similar to the 
experiences of Mr. Jiddu Krishnamurti. It was as if a divine power was educating and driving  the child. 
Many of his relatives and friends have confided to have had miraculous experien ces while being around 
the young prince. His parents were also astonished by the mysticism. The chil d’s aura was very strong 
and pure. 
 
At the age of 16, he had a strong bond with the divinity. He was given a task by the forces that cannot be 
seen with the naked eyes. He was told that he was chosen for a higher purpose, a purpose to  save 
humanity from the nuclear war that may break out any time. He was trained by the divine to see, 
perceive and use the cosmic energies to establish peace and harmony in the world. Thou gh his personal 
life was a roller coaster ride, he never failed in any projects taken up for the betterment of humanity. 
 
Mr. Amithaab grew up to be a fine young leader and a magnet that attracts the y outh. He was always 
surrounded by people. He had powers to rid people off their problems. As he con tinued with the divine 
mission to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war, he was soon joined by a group o f like-minded youth. So 
a team was formed under the leadership of the Chola Prince. These young boys and g irls were also 
connected with the divine spiritual energy and had similar out of world, mystic cosmic experiences in 
the past. Till date, this team is working selflessly under the leadership of Mr. Amithaab.


==================================================

==================================================

COSMIC EXPLANATIONS 
The operations carried out by the Chola prince and his team is more connected to spiri tuality. They are 
driven by the cosmos and communication with higher dimensional being and  divine souls. They are 
called by different names. In our religions, they are referred to as ‘Devathas’, ‘Farishtas’, ‘Angels’ and so 
on. In Science, they are called as ‘Positive aliens ’, ’inter galactic species ’, ‘extra terrestrials ’. Since a 
common man always believes in anything that is perceivable by his 5 senses, it h as been a very 
challenging task to convince people of their existence or the prince and his team ’s ability to 
communicate with them. Only a personal experience can answer this. But to have an ex perience, it 
requires faith. Faith is a strong energy of thought that helps you to tune in to the frequency  of higher 
souls. People fail to have such experiences or it becomes not possible for provi ding people with the 
spiritual experiences because they usually sign up to it to either test our com munications or to get their 
personal problems solved. 
 
Usually people think that spirituality is all about meditation and yoga. But it is not so. Spirituality is a vast 
domain that involves realizing your true sense and purpose and a lot more. The Yogis in the Himalayas 
sit in the caves and work in the cosmic plane. If the meditation was all abo ut mental peace, they would 
not have to dedicate their entire life sitting at one place. The Sanathan dharma speaks about different 
worlds consisting of devathas, nagas, yakshas, suras, dhanavas, rakshasas, kinnaras, kimpurushas, asuras 
and so on which cannot be found on earth. That means to say that they do not belong  to this planet. 
And scientifically your brain is just a transmitter and receiver of information, and con verter of energies 
perceivable into thoughts. It has peneal gland which helps to establish communication with energies not 
easily perceivable by the 5 senses. And the yogis and some of the spiritual leaders have their peneal 
gland active to communicate. This gland is made inactive due to pollution, vaccination, medicines and 
impaired secretion seratonin and melatonin in brain. The ancient scientists and mathema ticians such as 
Aryabhatta could determine the orbital movements of planets and the reflection of Sun's rays by moon 
without any telescope because they knew of technology that were more advanced than those that exis t 
today. And one of such is the astral communication using the peneal gland. 
 
The aliens or extra terrestrial beings are not comic figures like they show in movies but gods and 
goddesses that are illustrated with super powers and weapons that are a common technology i n their 
native planets. 
 
Spiritual ceremonies such as fire rituals, installation of idols of deities in temples and other ceremonies 
pertaining to different religions has been carried out since ages. These are believed to be just religious 
practices that are carried out in temples and prayer halls that are believed to ward off the people ’s 
problems in a mystic way. But only true yogis and yoginis who have spiritual powers understand that the 
spiritual ceremonies are not mere religious practices but a technology once used by our ancestors to tap 
and utilize cosmic spiritual energies for different purposes. Now these technologies or ways to use them 
are lost and they are understood only as mythological scriptures and practiced as a mere ceremo ny 
passes down the generations.

Message to the reader: 
 
 Usage of nuclear weapons on any country will result in devastation of life. The flora and fauna will be 
genetically mutated and their progeny will suffer for centuries together. Humans dead due to nuclear explosion 
will be the luckiest. Those who survive will be exposed to high levels of radi ations and will die a slow painful 
death due to cancer. The generations born at the site will be physically and mentally disabl ed and will be prone 
to cancer and other genetic diseases. Air and bio sphere reserves will be contaminated by rad iation and animals 
depending on these water forms will be affected by nuclear effluents and will start to die. The large mass of land 
will become unfit for livelihood. The wind blowing passing by these region will carry the imprints of radiations to 
other places and contaminate those regions as well. Now if a war breaks out among n ations and countries use 
nuclear weapons against each other, imagine the catastrophe we bring up on our selves.   
 
Keeping this in mind, Mr. A Amithaab and all the members of Chola Mandala Maha Sa msthaanam have 
been striving to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war since 2005. Since then, the prince and his team have been 
working day and night selflessly for the noble vision. The realization of this vi sion will result in the well being of 
our planet, mankind, eco system and all the inhabitants of Mother Earth. 
 
Mr. Amithaab ji and his team have been working under the ordinance of a supreme divin e. The 
application of spiritual cosmos has helped the Samsthaanam to prevent nuclear war until now. But to eradicate 
the issue completely, a temple of Mata Gandhareshwari, Mata Dwarakanateshwari and Shraap (Shaapa) Mukta  
Krishna has to be constructed at Hebbya, Mysore which forms a major epicenter of vast divi ne cosmic energy. 
This epicenter at Hebbya, Mysore falls at the personal property of Mr. A. Amithaab. 
 
The prince has a proposal to the Government of India and Minis try that if the Government 
extends its full support to construct the Mata Gandhareshwari, Mata Dwa rakanatheshwari and 
Shaapa Mukta Krishna temple at his property at Hebbya, he promises to provide an outstanding 
positive result towards preventing nuclear war and establishin g peace and harmony across the globe 
and these results will be evident to the Government within 48 days of Idol consecrations. In return, if 
the Government finds the results satisfying, he expects the Governme nt to further support his 
energy programs by providing permissions, allow unrestricted e ntry to various energy epicenters 
across India and in other countries to conduct yagna (fire rituals), I dol and Atma Lingh consecrations 
and construct temples. Sometimes military back up may also be necessary. 
 
He also adds that if he fails to provide the results that he pr omised, he promises to donate 
the entire property at Hebbya, Mysuru and along with the contructed  temples and its idols to 
Government in no expectation of what so ever in return. He would not wish to have any authority on 
the land and/or the temple.
